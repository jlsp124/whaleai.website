    <h2>3. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Whale AI provides tools for analyzing blockchain wallets, AI-driven insights, and automated copy-trading strategies on the Solana network. The Service is for informational and educational purposes only — not financial advice.</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>6. AI Insights and Trading Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>Whale AI provides AI-generated analytics and automated copy-trading features. These are not investment recommendations. You assume full responsibility for your trading decisions and acknowledge the high risk of cryptocurrency trading.</p>

    <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All content, software, and branding belong to Whale AI. You may not reuse or redistribute any material without prior written consent.</p>

    <h2>8. Third-Party Links and APIs</h2>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Whale AI and its team are not liable for losses from trading or investment decisions, errors/bugs/interruptions, or unauthorized access to wallets or data.

    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Whale AI, its owners, affiliates, and developers from claims, damages, or expenses arising from your use of the Service or violation of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>11. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access at any time, for any reason, without liability. Provisions that should survive termination (e.g., intellectual property, disclaimers, limitation of liability) shall continue.</p>

    <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of British Columbia, Canada. Disputes will be resolved exclusively in the courts of BC.</p>
